# What's My IP (React [Vite])

This project is viewable at: \
https://show-my-ip-react-vite.onrender.com/ \


This project is adapted from, or inspired by: \
https://github.com/Thorn5/React-What-s-My-IP \
Which was a group, one-day project that I participated in during my WBS full-stack coding bootcamp. 

As create-react-app has been depreciated, this project has uses Vite-React. 

## Vite BoilerPlate:
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
